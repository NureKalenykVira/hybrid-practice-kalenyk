"""HYBRID (neuro-symbolic) pipeline:

    problem text --(LLM formalizer)--> IR --(validation)--> Z3 solver --(presentation)--> answer

This is the main thing your team builds. The plumbing is here; the parts marked TODO(team) are yours.
Suggested order of work:
    1. write FORMALIZER_PROMPT and get formalize() returning sensible IR for one simple problem;
    2. implement validate_ir();
    3. add ONE retry with feedback in solve();
    4. fix run_solver() so that "unique" and "multiple" can be told apart;
    5. (extension) replace the LLM-based present() with deterministic code for some problem types.

See docs/ir.md for the IR format.
